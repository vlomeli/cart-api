This project is my submission for the Senior Web Development role at Digital Nest. It demonstrates my ability to build a functional and visually appealing frontend application using **React** and **CSS**.

---

## Features

- Fetches product data from an external API with proper asynchronous handling.
- Utilizes React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and lifecycle events.
- Implements filtering functionality with dynamic category selection.
- Stores relevant data in **local storage** to persist user selections or cart items.
- Clean, modular component structure for maintainability and scalability.
- Responsive design with attention to UI/UX details for a polished look.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vanilla CSS
- React Router for navigation
- Local Storage
- External API

---

## Future Improvements

- Improved Error Handling: While there is basic error handling in place, Iâ€™d like to add more user-friendly messaging, fallback UI components, and possibly retry options for failed API calls.
- Item Search: Enhance the product filtering with a search input to allow real-time querying by name or description.
